/**
 * PR Suggestion Service
 *
 * This service is currently disabled.
 * PR suggestions will be redesigned in a future sprint to be task-based
 * rather than message-based.
 *
 * The previous implementation used:
 * - githubRepoLinkId on suggestions table
 * - createdPrNumber and createdPrUrl to track created PRs
 * - reviewNotes for rejection reasons
 *
 * These columns have been removed from the schema.
