# Agentic CRM Documentation

This folder contains the comprehensive planning documents for transforming the PTS Portal into a fully agentic CRM powered by Google Workspace integrations.

## Documents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Vision & Architecture](./01-vision-architecture.md) | Core agentic CRM vision, Gmail integration, lead entity model, the five agentic loops |
| [Google Workspace Integration](./02-google-workspace-integration.md) | Complete Google Workspace integration map (Meet, Drive, Docs, Forms, Chat, etc.) |
| [Experimental Features](./03-experimental-features.md) | Advanced/experimental features: multi-agent systems, predictive intelligence, client-facing AI, etc. |

| [Implementation Roadmap](./05-implementation-roadmap.md) | Prioritized implementation phases and dependencies |

## Key Principles

1. **Human-in-the-loop** - AI suggests and drafts; humans review and approve
2. **Incremental autonomy** - Start conservative, earn trust, dial up autonomy over time
3. **Gmail as backbone** - Email is the communication hub connecting all entities
4. **Everything connected** - Leads, clients, projects, tasks, emails, meetings form a knowledge graph
5. **Proactive, not reactive** - The system surfaces insights and suggests actions before being asked
