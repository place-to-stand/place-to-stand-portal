**For the CTO meeting:** Start with [EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md](./EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md)

## Documents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|

| [Experimental Features](./03-experimental-features.md) | Advanced/experimental features: multi-agent systems, predictive intelligence, client-facing AI, etc. |

## Key Principles

1. **Human-in-the-loop** - AI suggests and drafts; humans review and approve
2. **Incremental autonomy** - Start conservative, earn trust, dial up autonomy over time
3. **Gmail as backbone** - Email is the communication hub connecting all entities
4. **Everything connected** - Leads, clients, projects, tasks, emails, meetings form a knowledge graph
5. **Proactive, not reactive** - The system surfaces insights and suggests actions before being asked
